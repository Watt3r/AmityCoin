### AMITY INFORMATION
**The word Amity means "Friendly Relations" and that couldn't describe us any better**

**The Coin**

AmityCoin is private, untraceable and unlinkable giving all the more reasons to use it. With a blockchain that cannot be analyzed, this means you can feel safe when spending AmityCoin as nobody can see where it & how much is going. Using a Payment ID when pauing somebody can verify that it came from you and nobody else. AmityCoin cannot be hacked, forged or altered for greedy needs as it works upon itself to change its way of thinking to stop attacks from happening. The only way is to be from future, are you from the future?

**The Technology**

AmityCoin has a few features to its technology as well as being private. With the CryptoNightV7 algorithm, this makes ASIC machines obsolete to AmityCoin so they cannot take over the network hashing rate to "steal all the coins" as the hashing algorithm won't let it. It also implements LWMA-2 which makes sure block times stick to 90 seconds. We also have added security with privaye keys for your wallet allowing you to transport it to an online Web Wallet AmityCoin provides.

**The Business Plan**

The long-term goal for AmityCoin is to be globally accepted, as much as FIAT is, so you could use it to spend in near enough any shop you come across. Over the next few years we will hire teams in different countries and cities to try and get AmityCoin accepted in to their shops. Once we have established a connection with the smaller businesses, we will proress to try and get larger businesses on board to see the benefits of AmityCoin.

**The Future**

The promise of a decentralized way of making payments is possible but only with a team and community that is will to do something to make that happen. We believe being decentralized will solve some of the worlds problems but also create some as some still believe banks are safe and are the way forward, never properly knowing what it is like without one.

**Community Projects**

Once we have fully established ourselfs, AmityCoin will set up fund rasing scheme for its members. This will consist of users uploading a link to their own developed software, music, art or anything else in a chance to earn some considerable donations from AmityCoin and its team. This will allow that user to do things that money would of been an object to do.

# What We Need From You

**Developers**
Bringing more developers will help to achieve the goals in line set for the AmityCoin adaption. We intend to keep ASIC resistant so that AmityCoin stays as durable as planned. Developers of different languages will hopefully improve the coins codebase and make it more adaptable. iOS & Android wallets are in future sights allowing mobile users to check and spend their balance while they're *out and about*.

**Investors**
Investors are the way to success in another way that coins without funds to do anything
go extinct as they simply cannot afford to achieve goals. We hope that someone looks
at our coin and its hopeful future and realise this has potential to become a
incredible part of the Crypto and real life communities. This would help us get listed
on an exchange quicker as well as paying for future projects and giveaways.

**Community Members**
We believe these guys are also a big part of Amity because these are the people that
the coin is made for, normal everyday people. By having a community to thrieve upon
will help with adaption as they can verify its every we claim it to be and more. Our Discord
is the best place to stay active with the forever growing community.
